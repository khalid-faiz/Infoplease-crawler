# Infoplease-crawler
 A python program [spidering_articles.py] to pull infoplease.com articles and svae them in a local sqlite database.
 
I editted Dr. Cuck's spider.py and gmane.py codes to create this code.

The code does every thing the spder.py does just add a new coloumn in th database called article in which I save the article of that link if found.
